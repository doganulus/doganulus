# Dogan Ulus

I am an assistant professor of Computer Science at the [Department of Computer Engineering](https://github.com/bouncmpe) at Boğaziçi University. The primary focus of my research is to develop testing, verification, and validation tools and techniques that support the development of complex cyber-physical systems including highly automated driving systems and autonomous robots. All based on formal methods and good software development practices...

## Short Bio

Dogan Ulus obtained his BSc and MSc in Electrical Engineering from the Boğaziçi University, Istanbul, Turkey in 2011 and in 2013, respectively. He completed his Ph.D. thesis, [Pattern Matching with Time: Theory and Applications](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-01901576) at the [Verimag](https://www-verimag.imag.fr/) laboratory, Grenoble, France, in 2018 under the liberal supervision of Dr. Oded Maler. After a post-doc at the Boston University Robotics Lab, he switched to the industry as a senior verification engineer at Samsung Semiconductor, Inc. in San Jose, CA, USA to work on testing automated driver assistance systems at Smart Machines group. He joined the Department of Computer Engineering at Boğaziçi University, Istanbul, Turkey as an assistant professor in 2021. His research interests include runtime verification, safety validation of highly automated driving systems, and automata theory.
